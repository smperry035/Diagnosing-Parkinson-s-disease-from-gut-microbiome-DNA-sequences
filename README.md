# Diagnosing-Parkinson-s-disease-from-gut-microbiome-DNA-sequences
The gut microbiome is connected with several health conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Since Parkinson's disease is difficult to diagnose, taking DNA sequences of fecal samples, which represent the gut microbiome, has been used previously to distinguish between patients with and without Parkinson's with a high accuracy (Scheperjans et al., 2014). However, very few of the previous researchers used machine learning models for this task. Based on previous success using natural language processing to classify DNA sequences (Wahab et al., 2021), I used a bag of words model and an Artificial Neural Network on a small portion of the data collected by a previous study (Scheperjans et al., 2014) to classify patients as having Parkinson's or not having Parkinson's with an accuracy of 0.561. Future work will include adjusting hyperparameters, trying different types of neural networks, and training the model on the full dataset.
